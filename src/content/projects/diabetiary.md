As a diabetic type I patient, one of the keys of success and wellbeing is to adapt your insulin doses. Let's explain it better with an example where I'm going to tremendusly simplify everything:

A correct range for a diabetic person would be **_80-150 mg/dL_** and anything above **_180 mg/dL_** is consider high sugar levels.

We check our sugar level before each meal. Depending of that value, you may need to add or substract 1-2 or more extra insulin units to correct the high/low sugar level. If those levels continue in time at the same meal, you need to fix it modifying your base insulin dosage.

Back in 2020, couldn't find any app which atack this simple and important issue.

That's when I designed and developed Diabetiary. Spoiler alert: I abandoned the project because of the [Abbot sensor](https://www.freestyle.abbott/es-es/inicio.html) given by the spanish public healthcare system.

The main goal of the app was to notify the user that they need to modify their dosage, pointing out that in some meals they have an incorrect constant value.
